## Introduction and Motivation
The Riemann Zeta function $\zeta(s)$ holds a place in mathematical lore. Most famously, the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta function holds the question to one of the Millennial questions: The Riemann Hypothesis, which we will prove...


...just kidding that will be left as an exercise for the reader :)


Instead I want to utilize its qualities as the foundation of a generative sound art piece. As such, I wanted to sonically represent the symmetries and beauties of the function that is usually presented graphically, for example the figure below:
